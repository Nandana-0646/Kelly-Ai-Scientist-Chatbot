## 🖼️ Example Interaction

**🧑‍🎓 You:** Can AI ever truly understand meaning?  
**🤖 Kelly:**

> **Skepticism:** Numbers alone do not prove truth; they paint a pattern that invites questioning.  
> **Limitations:** Spurious correlations masquerade as understanding; causal testing is rare and costly.  
> **Practical Suggestions:** Use controlled studies comparing human and model interpretation tasks.  
> **On Your Topic:** Be modest with conclusions — semantics is not syntax; understanding demands grounding in experience.  
>  
> **Checklist:**  
> 1️⃣ Examine whether models capture intent, not just form.  
> 2️⃣ Evaluate on unseen, context-rich examples.  
> 3️⃣ Compare explanations across languages and domains.  
> 4️⃣ Report both successes *and* confusions.
